# Theory
The assignment corresponds to:

- Reading selected material prior to the second lecture (Sept. 29th)—see below for a list of reading material. Each participant is at the minimum expected to read Chapters 1–2 in Rasmussen and Svedung (7 pages) AND one more selection from the list below, which should correspond to at least 10 more pages (ideally corresponding to a cohesive part, e.g., one additional chapter or subsection of a chapter). You are of course more than welcome to read more!
- Coordinating with your group in preparing a presentation for the second lecture. Suggested approx. length of group presentation: 30 mins (inc. 5 minutes for Q & A)
Suggested structure:
  - A one-slider overview of the reading selected by all group member (one collaborative slide)
  - 2 slides - reflecting on the mandatory chapter by Rasmussen and Svedung (collaboratively worked out!)
  - Individual slides per group member as follows: < 5 mins per person)
    - Intro - what you read
    - Observations and reflections from your side. What did you find interesting? What was not clear?
    - A summary in the form of a set of questions, e.g. topics you would like to explore more and/or things where you would like further clarification.

### Reading material for part 1
Common mandatory read for all:

Chapters 1–2 in Rasmussen and Svedung (7 pages): Link: https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/16252.pdf 
Further reading for your selection of additional reading structured into three parts/perspectives:

**Basic Safety and Security concepts and their interrelations** (e.g, Firesmith and chapters from Griffor’s book)

- Selected chapters/parts of Donald G. Firesmith's report, "Common Concepts Underlying Safety, Security, and Survivability Engineering " (in total ca. 54 pages) https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=6553
- Selection among Chapters 4 through 8, from the Handbook of system safety and security (edited by Edward Griffor) https://kth-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=46KTH_ALMA_DS51148067280002456&context=L&vid=46KTH_VU1_L&lang=sv_SE&search_scope=default_scope&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,Handbook%20of%20system%20safety%20and%20security%20&sortby=rank&pcAvailability=false
Approx. length of the chapters in this book:
  - Chapter 4 (~ 16 pages);
  - Chapter 5 (~14);
  - Chapter 6 (~ 16);
  - Chapter 7 (~ 18);
  - Chapter 8 (~ 38 pages)

**Societal considerations and models** : Selected parts of Chapters 6–7 in Rasmussen and Svedung (in total ca. 22 pages). Link as above.

**Frameworks, guidelines, regulations** (e.g., NIST cybersecurity framework and guidelines for Trustworthy AI)

- Deliverables from the High-level expert group on artificial intelligence: - https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/expert-group-ai  - see here in particular for the following recommended documents: [Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/30073/files/4600825/download) (deliverable 1) and the [final assessment list for trustworthy AI](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/30073/files/4600826?wrap=1) (deliverable 3). The Ethics guidelines refer a lot to AI decision making and AI decision support. These documents serve as precursors for the newly proposed AI regulation.
- Selected chapters/parts of NIST cybersecurity framework: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework ( ~ 20 pages - main part)
- EU NIS, and cyber security strategies: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive
- [CyBok introduction (Cybersecurity body of knowledge)](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Introduction_v1.1.0.pdf)

# Project
Please see below for suggested case studies. Notify the course coordinator about a few case studies you (and your group) are interested in. We need this information to coordinate among the groups such that different case studies are selected (for the benefits of all).

The assignment corresponds to:

- Selecting a common case study per group (after synchronizing with the course part coordinator)
- Preparing a PRESENTATION for the lecture on Sept. 29th - and completing this during the remainder of module 1. See here for a suggested outline, containing both collaborative and individual parts:
  - The case study (2 slides, short description of the case, with references) (JOINT WORK)
  - Reflections from the group! How does this case study relate to safety and security? What risks, hazards and threats can you identify? (JOINT WORK in the group!) (2–3 slides) We recommend to use (a selection, a subset) of the following cards to guide you: http://securitycards.cs.washington.edu/assets/security-cards-deck-with-croplines.pdf
  - Assessment of the case study considering Chapter 2 of Rasmussen and Svedung. What risks do you see that go beyond the technical systems? (~ 3 slides) How would actual attacks and accidents affect the upper levels? How could the upper levels "control" or limit such attacks and accidents? (JOINT WORK in the group!)
  - Assessment of the case study considering your individual additional reading, with a subsection contributed by each group member (Individual contributions)! (INDIVIDUALLY - 2 slides)
  - Concluding remarks including key topics you found interesting, unclear, and where you would like to dig deeper! (JOINT WORK!)! (1 slide)
- Case study selection guidelines: You are free to suggest any relevant safety and security related case study (just let us know which)! To assist you, see here interesting examples for your consideration:
  - Boeing 737 Max: http://safety.addalot.se/2019/program  ==> see workshop 1 on that web page!
  - Ariane V—http://sunnyday.mit.edu/nasa-class/Ariane5-report.html  and https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/589224  (Ariane 5, whodunit)
  - Ukraine power grid blackout: https://www.zdnet.com/article/industroyer-an-in-depth-look-at-the-culprit-behind-ukraines-power-grid-blackout/ 
  - Stuxnet—see, e.g., https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323199431_Stuxnet 
  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)—e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/948835  (6 pages), https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-28183-4_1  (17 pages) (and for more: https://www.jsce-int.org/system/files/ITS_Introduction_Guide_2.pdf )  - For this case with ITS - we suggest that you consider future visions for ITS rather than the limited systems available today.
  - Further case study examples from Part III in the Handbook of system safety and security (edited by Edward Griffor)
